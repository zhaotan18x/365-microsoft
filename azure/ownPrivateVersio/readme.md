# Own private version

Well maybe free, but Microsoft had created an Azure free account (websites) for who like practices, interesting about more Azure cloud services, integration, migration, security and data protection, run REST APIs and other cloud services systems. As all known creating an Azure account it's free and receive 12 month (with credit). There is another method similar way get Azure cloud environment. 

Normally if is company admin(s) or receive companies admin roles/levels permissions, then is accessfully sort of permissions path go to these path of the websites and tools `admin.microosft.com` , `azure.portal.com`. If webpage is not working or other reason it might be need licenses, or permissions or subscriptions or other troublehsoots. Anyway creating an Azure account it's still free for 12month and give a free credit values to user. Latest information Feb 2024.

- For "freelancer" or who continues practices with microsoft services like own environment, just go to this webpage; `entra.microsoft.com` (it is like azure ad / admin center, but this type might be for free and the idea is like small company azure user identity and access management environment)

entra id is working as identify/same as other services tools like `aad.portal.azure.com` / azure portal `portal.azure.com`
so.. where this account go and what url path this offers likes;
- `portal.azure.com`
- `entra.microsoft.com` == (same as) `aad.portal.azure.com`
- `admin.microsoft.com` (well tried, so no work..) 
- `intune.microsoft.com` (MDM)
- check email, write word, powerpoint and excel sheets just browser version, if need desktop (buy a licenses..)

Sort of tools and page path can not go through like;
- `security.microsoft` - not available / not offered..
- `admin.microsoft.com` - admin center not available, and of course others can see like (exchange, sharepoints and ect)

Because at least there need another account for who can got access like (Global admin - Can manage all aspects of Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft services that use Microsoft Entra identities.) Of course can be few (more than one got this permission levels)

## Before login 

Before login, there need to be a real microsoft account (private account might be fine), just login with it. Is like own email account what will receive <b> free default settings and licenses </b> using by Teams, Outlook, Word, powershell, excel application and onedrive 5Gb (cloud storage). But currenlty at Windows desktop support Microsoft accounts like can use it as Outlook (new) desktop app and Teams app. Small new is a can receive free Azure Cloud server by using License Microsoft Entra ID Free version.

At "Default directory | overview" --> Manage tenants --> got this same account when logged in (<nicknameDomain>@hotmail.com)
but domain name is: <nicknameDomain>.onmicrosoft.com

if want to create another tenant as create new company will be give a good name (such a new company and new tenant), and the configuration at end will be <domainName>.onmicrosoft.com 

of course can another domain names, under "manager/custom domain names", but if add another domain name configuration will happening at "manage tenants" (let's not focusing that, im not creating company name, "techpad" is fine).

this account "techpad99" is as global administrator role as super root / admininistrator.

if this site got multiple user or few users, so.. there is might be no problem if create another user. But creating user will coming user principal name (like email account) as login username, "NAME@USERDOMAINNAME.onmicrosoft.com"

where need subscriptions, using portal.azure.com bash or powershell command line, or other resources like vm, creating other resources more database storage, devops, logic app, automation, windows server 2019, ubuntu, red hat and ect. getting more services and marketplaces tools like more practicing.
