# Own private version

Free `entra.microsoft account`

well maybe free, but for need the an Azure environment view, maybe NEED real account for it and it will be 12month (with credit). Actually, there might be another similar way go to Azure ad path, but it's all same microsoft service(s). So, without create or go to "Get started with Azure".

normally if is company admin(s), then normally login with: admin.microsoft.com , OR if need azure.portal.com environment need licenses or account or permissions, but currenlty (feb 2024) latest information it's free, but need credit card for 12 month and free X credit values. And of course it got few options license types.

for "freelancer" or who continues practices with microsoft services, just go to this webpage; entra.microsoft.com (it is like azure ad / admin center, but this type might be for free)

entra id is working as identify/same as other services tools like (aad.portal.azure.com) / azure portal (portal.azure.ocm)
so.. where this account go and what url path this offers likes;
- `portal.azure.com`
- `entra.microsoft.com` == (same as) aad.portal.azure.com
- `admin.microsoft.com` (well tried, so no work..) 
- `intune.microsoft.com` (MDM)
- check email, write word, powerpoint and excel sheets just browser version, if need desktop (buy a licenses..)

not offered / at least tried and checked
- `security.microsoft` - not available / not offered..
- `admin.microsoft.com` - admin center not available, and of course others can see like (exchange, sharepoints and ect)

## Before login 

Before login need real microsoft account (private account might be fine), just login with it. Ddefault directory overview is free anyway (License Microsoft Entra ID Free).

At "Default directory | overview" --> Manage tenants --> got this same account when logged in (<nicknameDomain>@hotmail.com)
but domain name is: <nicknameDomain>.onmicrosoft.com

if want to create another tenant as create new company will be give a good name (such a new company and new tenant), and the configuration at end will be <domainName>.onmicrosoft.com 

of course can another domain names, under "manager/custom domain names", but if add another domain name configuration will happening at "manage tenants" (let's not focusing that, im not creating company name, "techpad" is fine).

this account "techpad99" is as global administrator role as super root / admininistrator.

if this site got multiple user or few users, so.. there is might be no problem if create another user. But creating user will coming user principal name (like email account) as login username, "NAME@USERDOMAINNAME.onmicrosoft.com"

where need subscriptions, using portal.azure.com bash or powershell command line, or other resources like vm, creating other resources more database storage, devops, logic app, automation, windows server 2019, ubuntu, red hat and ect. getting more services and marketplaces tools like more practicing.
